    **Overview**

    **Bill of materials**

    - a DLWPS7 unit and power cable connected to power plug

    - a network cable

    - a connection to a network switch to which the server is also
      connected (*nsN*)

    **Connecting the power switch**

    Choose a name for the power switch (for example: *spM*), where *M*
    is a number.

    There are multiple valid ways to connect smart PDUs to the
    network; it is recommended they are in an isolated network

    - Isolated network

      1. Ensure you have configured an class C *192.168.X.0/24*,
         configured with static IP addresses, to which maybe only this
         server has access to connect IP-controlled power
         switches.
  
         Follow :ref:`these instructions <internal_network>` to create a
         network.
  
         You might need a new Ethernet adaptor to connect to said
         network (might be PCI, USB, etc).
  
      2. connect the power switch to said network
  
      3. enter the *PDUNAME* name in ``/etc/hosts`` as described
         above.
  
         .. warning:: if your system uses proxies, you need to add
            *PDUNAME* also to the *no_proxy* environment variables in
            :file:`/etc/bashrc` and others to avoid the daemon trying
            to access the power switch through the proxy, which will
            not work.

    **Configuring the system**

    1. The power switch starts with IP address *192.168.0.100*; it needs
       to be changed.

       Determine which IP address the PDU will have (static, DHCP, etc)

       There are multiple ways to do this, but this guide is by no
       means complete:

       - routing hack on a local Linux machine: in a machine connected
         to a wired network, add a secondary IP address in the
         *192.168.0.0/24* network and access the PDU through that:

         a. select the network interface (eg: *eth0*)

         b. add routing through an alias::

              # ifconfig eth0:2 192.168.0.3/24

         c. ensure the PDU is connected to the same network switch as
            the Linux machine

       - USB Network dongle connected directly (or with a crossover
         cable if needed) to the PDU:

              # ifconfig IFACENAME 192.168.0.3/24

    2. With a web browser, access the switch's web control interface
       at *http://192.168.0.100*

    3. Enter the default user *admin*, password *1234*, select *ok*

    4. Scroll down to *Setup* menu to configure the different parts
       needed; on each of this steps, make sure to hit submit for each
       individual change.

       a. Lookup setup of IP address, change to the chosen IP address
          (or DHCP if so selected); hit the *submit* next to it.

       b. Disable the security lockout in section *Delay*

          Set *Wrong password lockout* set to zero minutes

       c. Turn on setting power after power loss:

          *Power Loss Recovery Mode > When recovering after power
          loss* select *Turn all outlets on*

       d. Extra steps needed for newer units
          (https://dlidirect.com/products/new-pro-switch)

          The new refreshed unit looks the same, but has wifi
          connectivity and pleny of new features, some of which
          need tweaking; login to the setup page again and for each
          of this, set the value/s and hit *submit* before going to
          the next one:

          - Access setings (quite important, as this allows the
            driver to access the same way for the previous
            generation of the product too):

            ENABLE: *allow legacy plaintext login methods*

            Note below it is explained why this is not a security
            problem in this kind of deployments. On shared networks,
            an upgrade to https might be needed.

       e. If the PDU is in an isolated network, keep the default user
          and password at *admin*/*1234*, the default configuration
          relies on it. It makes no sense to change it anyway as you
          will have to write them down in the
          configuration. Limitations of HTTP Basic Auth.

       f. If the routing hack method was used, remove it::

            # ifconfig eth0:2 down


    If the name of the PDU does not resolve over DNS, you might add it
    to the server's */etc/hosts*::

       IPADDRESS  PDUNAME PDUNAME.DOMAINNAME

    (the domainname is optional)

    Implementation interface for a console driver

    The target will list the available consoles in the targets'
    *consoles* tag

    :param list command_sequence: (optional) when the console is
      enabled (from :meth:`target.console.enable
      <tcfl.target_ext_console.extension.enable>` or when powering up
      a target that also enables the console at the same time via
      :meth:`target.power.on <tcfl.target_ext_power.extension.on>`),
      run a sequence of send/expect commands.

      This is commonly used when the serial line is part of a server
      and a set of commands have to be typed before the serial
      connection has to be established. For example, for some
      Lantronix KVM serial servers, when accessing the console over
      SSH we need to wait for the prompt and then issue a *connect
      serial* command; see :class:ttbl.lantronix.console_spider_duo_pc;
      it looks like:

      >>> serial0_pc = ttbl.console.ssh_pc(
      >>>     "USER:PASSWORD@LANTRONIXHOSTNAME",
      >>>     command_sequence = [
      >>>       ## Welcome to the Lantronix SLSLP
      >>>       ## Firmware: version 030031, build 38120
      >>>       ## Last login: Thu Jan  1 00:04:20 1970 from 10.24.11.35
      >>>       ## Current time: Thu Jan  1 00:02:03 1970
      >>>       ## For a list of commands, type 'help'
      >>>
      >>>       # command prompt, 'CR[USERNAME@IP]> '... or not, so just
      >>>       # look for 'SOMETHING> '
      >>>       # ^ will not match because we are getting a Carriage
      >>>       # Return / New Line
      >>>       (
      >>>           # send a disconnect just in case it is connected
      >>>           # and wait for the command prompt
      >>>           "\\x1bexit\\r\\n",
      >>>           # command prompt, 'CR[USERNAME@IP]> '... or not, so just
      >>>           # look for 'SOMETHING> '

      This list a list of:

      - tupples *( SECONDS, COMMENT )*: wait SECONDs, printing COMMENT
        in the logs

      - tupples *( SEND, EXPECT )*; *SEND* is a string
        sent over to the console (unless the empty string; then nothing
        is sent).  *EXPECT* can be anything that can be fed to Python's
        Expect :meth:`expect <pexpect.spawn.expect>` function:

        - a string

        - a compiled regular expression

        - a list of such

      The timeout for each expectation is hardcoded to five seconds
      (FIXME).

      Note for this to work, the driver that uses this class must call
      the *_command_sequence_run()* method from their
      :meth:`impl_c.enable` methods.

    :param int command_timeout: (optional) number of seconds to wait
      for a response ot a command before declaring a timeout

    :param str crlf: (optional; default *None*) newline convention for
      this console; this is informational for the clients, to know which
      string they need to use as end of line; the only practical
      choices are:

    - allows raw traffic (not just pure ASCII), for example for serial
      console escape sequences, etc

    - the client shall not need to be constantly reading to avoid
      loosing data; the read path shall be (can be) implemented to
      buffer everything since power on (by creating a power control
      driver :class:`ttbl.power.impl_c` that records everything; see

    """General base console implementation

    This object will implement a base console driver that reads from a
    file in the (the read file) and writes to a file (the write file)
    in the local filesystem.

    The read / write files are named
    ``console-CONSOLENAME.{read,write}`` and are located in the
    target's state directory. Thus there is no need for state, since
    the parameters are available in the call.

    The idea is that another piece (normally a power control unit that
    starts a background daemon) will be reading from the console in
    the target system and dumping data to the read file. For writing,
    the same piece takes whatever data is being provided and passes it
    on, or it can be written directly.

    See :class:`serial_pc` for an example of this model implemented
    over a tranditional serial port and
    :class:`ttbl.ipmi.sol_console_pc` for implementing an IPMI
    Serial-Over-Lan console. :class:`ssh_pc` for implementing a
    console simulated over an SSH connection.

    :param int chunk_size: (optional) when writing, break the writing
      in chunks of this size and wait *interchunk_wait* in between
      sending each chunk. By default is 0, which is disabled.

    :param float interchunk_wait: (optional) if *chunk_size* is
      enabled, time to wait in seconds in between each chunk.

    :param dict escape_chars: (optional) dictionary of escape
      sequences for given characters to prefix in input stream.

      If given, this is a dictionary of characters to strings, eg:

      >>> escape_chars = {
      >>>   '\\x1b': '\\x1b',
      >>>   '~': '\\',
      >>> }

      in this case, when the input string to send to the device
      contains a *\\x1b* (the ESC character), it will be prefixed with
      another one. If it contains a *~*, it will be prefixed with a
      backslash.

    Implement a serial port console and data recorder

    This class implements two interfaces:

    - power interface: to start a serial port recorder in the
      background as soon as the target is powered on. Anything read
      form the serial port is written to the *console-NAME.read* file
      and anything written to it is written to *console-NAME.write*
      file, which is sent to the serial port.

      The power interface is implemented by subclassing
      :class:`ttbl.power.socat_pc`, which starts *socat* as daemon to
      serve as a data recorder and to pass data to the serial port
      from the read file.

    - console interface: interacts with the console interface by
      exposing the data recorded in *console-NAME.read* file and
      writing to the *console-NAME.write* file.

    :params str serial_file_name: (optional) name of the serial port
      file, which can be templated with *%(FIELD)s* as per
      class:`ttbl.power.socat_pc` (the low level implementation).

      By default, it uses */dev/tty-TARGETNAME*, which makes it easier
      to configure. The tty name linked to the target can be set with
      :ref:`udev <usb_tty>`.

    For example, create a serial port recoder power control / console
    driver and insert it into the power rail and the console of a
    target:

    >>> serial0_pc = ttbl.console.serial_pc(console_file_name)
    >>>
    >>> ttbl.test_target.get(name).interface_add(
    >>>     "power",
    >>>     ttbl.power.interface(
    >>>         ...
    >>>         serial0_pc,
    >>>         ...
    >>>     )
    >>> ttbl.test_target.get(name).interface_add(
    >>>     "console",
    >>>     ttbl.console.interface(

    """Implement a general console/data recorder

    When an implementation creates a file we can write to to get data
    into a console (represented as *STATEDIR/console-NAME.write*),
    this implementation will write to said file on *write()* and
    whatever is read from said file, will be recorded to
    *STATEDIR/console-NAME.read*).

    This class is different to similarly name
    :class:`ttbl.console.generic_c` in that this implements a full
    console and *generic_c* is a building block.

    Use cases:

    - QEMU/virtualized target which represents its console via a
      Unix socket or PTY -- the driver target, before starting the
      serial console symlinks *STATEDIR/console-NAME.write* to
      */dev/pts/XYZ*, (see ttbl.qemu._qemu_console_on() as an
      example).

    Do not use this for:

    - Serial port consoles (use :class:`serial_pc`)

    - Consoles over SSH or telnet (use :class:`ssh_pc` or
      :class:`telnet_pc`)

    - Exposing logfiles (use :class:`logfile_c`)

    This class, given a file where to capture from, implements two
    interfaces:

    - power interface: starts a a recorder in the background on power
      on which will write to *console-NAME.read* anything read from
      file *console-NAME.write*, which is assumed to exist.

      The power interface is implemented by subclassing
      :class:`ttbl.power.socat_pc`, which starts *socat* as daemon to
      serve as a data recorder.

    - console interface: interacts with the console interface by
      exposing the data recorded in *console-NAME.read* file and
      writing to the *console-NAME.write* file.

    :params str file_name: (optional) name of file to use as source of
      data and sink. Defaults to *console-NAME.write*, where *NAME*
      is the name under which the console is registered.

    For example, create a serial port recoder power control / console
    driver and insert it into the power rail and the console of a
    target:

    >>>

    """Implement a serial port over a telnet connection

    A telnet connection is open to the remote end, anything written to
    the console is sent there, anything read is received and recorded
    for the console interface to send to clients.

    This class implements two interfaces:

    - power interface: to start a telnet connection recorder in the
      background as soon as the target is powered on.

      The power interface is implemented by subclassing
      :class:`ttbl.power.socat_pc`, which starts *socat* as daemon to
      serve as a data recorder and to pass data to the connection
      from the read file.

      Anything read form the telnet connection is written to the
      *console-NAME.read* file and anything written to it is written
      to *console-NAME.write* file, which is sent to the remote
      machine.

    - console interface: interacts with the console interface by
      exposing the data recorded in *console-NAME.read* file and
      writing to the *console-NAME.write* file.

    :params str hostname: IP address or hostname of the
      target. A username can be specified with *username@hostname*;
      passwords are not yet supported.

    :params int port: (optional; default *23*) port number to connect
      to.

    Other parameters as to :class:`generic_c`.

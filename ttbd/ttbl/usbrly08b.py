    A power control implementation for the USB-RLY08B relay controller
    https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/usb_rly08btech.htm.

    This serves as base for other drivers to implement :class:`per
    relay power controllers <pc>`, :class:`USB pluggers as *thing* or
    power controllers <plugger>`.

    This device offers eight relays for AC and DC. The relays being on
    or off are controlled by a byte-oriented serial protocol over an
    FTDI chip that shows as::

      $ lsusb.py -iu
      ...

         1-1.1.1:1.1   (IF) 0a:00:00 2EPs (CDC Data:) cdc_acm
      ...

    Note the *00023456* is the serial number.

    To avoid permission issues, it can either:

    - The default rules in most Linux platforms will make the
      device node owned by group *dialout*, so make the daemon
      have that supplementary GID.

    - add a UDEV rule to ``/etc/udev/rules.d/90-ttbd.rules`` (or
      other name)::

        SUBSYSTEM == "tty", ENV{ID_SERIAL_SHORT} == "00023456", \
          GROUP="GROUPNAME", MODE = "660"

      restart *udev**::

        $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

      replug your hubs so the rule is set.

    Implement a USB multiplexor/plugger that allows a DUT to be
    plugged to Host B and to Host A when unplugged. It follows it can
    work as a USB cutter if Host A is disconnected.

    It also implements a power control implementation, so when powered
    off, it plugs-to-Host-B and when powered on, it
    plugs-to-host-A. Likewise, if Host B is disconnected, when off it
    is effectively disconnected. This serves to for example, connect a
    USB storage drive to a target that will be able to access it when
    turned on and when off, it can be connected to another machine
    that can, eg: use it to flash software.

    This uses a :class:`rly08b` relay bank to do the switching.

    :param str serial_number: USB serial number of the USB-RLY8B
        device used to control

    :param int bank: bank of relays to use; bank 0 are relays 1-4,
        bank 1 are relays 5-8. Note below for connection information.

    **System setup details**

    - A USB connection is four cables: VCC (red), D+ (white), D-
      (green), GND (black) plus a shielding wrapping it all.

    - A relay has three terminals; NO, C and NC.
      - ON means C and NC are connected
      - OFF means C and NO are connected

      (it is recommended to label the cable connected to NO as
       OFF/PLUGGED and the one to NC as ON/UNPLUGGED)

    - We use the USB-RLY8B, which has eight individual relays, so we can
      switch two devices between two USB hosts each.

    We connect the DUT's cables and host cables as follows:

    =========== ===  =========== ===  =========== ===
    DUT1        pin  Host A1/ON  pin  Host B1/OFF pin
    ----------- ---  ----------- ---  ----------- ---
    VCC (red)    1C  VCC (red)   1NO  VCC (red)   1NC
    D+  (white)  2C  D+  (white) 2NO  D+  (white) 2NC
    D-  (green)  3C  D-  (green) 3NO  D-  (green) 3NC
    GND (black)  4C  GND (black) 4NO  GND (black) 4NC
    =========== ===  =========== ===  =========== ===

    =========== ===  =========== ===  =========== ===
    DUT2        pin  Host A2/ON  pin  Host B1/OFF pin
    ----------- ---  ----------- ---  ----------- ---
    VCC (red)    5C  VCC (red)   5NO  VCC (red)   5NC
    D+  (white)  6C  D+  (white) 6NO  D+  (white) 6NC
    D-  (green)  7C  D-  (green) 7NO  D-  (green) 7NC
    GND (black)  8C  GND (black) 8NO  GND (black) 8NC
    =========== ===  =========== ===  =========== ===

    For example, to switch an Arduino 101 between a NUC and the TTBD
    server that flashes and controls it:

    - DUT (C) is our Arduino 101,
    - Host B (NC) is another NUC machine in the TCF infrastructure
    - Host A (NO) is the TTBD server (via the YKUSH port)

    For a pure USB cutter (where we don't need the connection to a
    TTBD server on MCU boards that expose a separate debugging cable
    for power and flashing), we'd connect the USB port like:

    - DUT (C) is the MCU's USB port
    - Host B (NC) is the NUC machine in the TCF infrastructure
    - Host A (NO) is left disconnected

    .. note:: switching *ONLY* the VCC and GND connections (always
              leave D+ and D- connected the the Host A to avoid Host B
              doing a data connection and only being used to supply
              power) does not work.

              Host A still detects the power differential in D+ D- and
              thought there was a device; tried to enable it, failed
              and disabled the port.

    .. note:: We can't turn them on or off at the same time because
              the HW doesn't allow to set a mask and we could override
              settings for the other ports we are not controlling
              here--another server process might be tweaking the other
              ports.

    ** Configuration details **

    Example:

      To connect a USB device from system A to system B, so power off
      means connected to B, power-on connected to A, add to the
      configuration:

      >>> target.interface_add("power", ttbl.power.inteface(
      >>>      ttbl.usbrly08b.plugger("00023456", 0)
      >>> )
      >>> ...

      Thus to connect to system B::

        $ tcf acquire devicename
        $ tcf power-off devicename

      Thus to connect to system A::

        $ tcf power-on devicename

    Example:

      If system B is the ttbd server, then you can refine it to test
      the USB device is connecting/disconnecting.

      To connect a USB drive to a target before the target is powered
      on (in this example, a NUC mini-PC with a USB drive connected
      to boot off it, the configuration block would be as::

      >>> target.interface_add("power", ttbl.power.interface(
      >>>     # Ensure the dongle is / has been connected to the server
      >>>     ttbl.pc.delay_til_usb_device("7FA50D00FFFF00DD",
      >>>                                  when_powering_on = False,
      >>>                                  want_connected = True),
      >>>     ttbl.usbrly08b.plugger("00023456", 0),
      >>>     # Ensure the dongle disconnected from the server
      >>>     ttbl.pc.delay_til_usb_device("7FA50D00FFFF00DD",
      >>>                                  when_powering_on = True,
      >>>                                  want_connected = False),
      >>>     # power on the target
      >>>     ttbl.pc.dlwps7("http://admin:1234@SPNAME/SPPORT"),
      >>>     # let it boot
      >>>     ttbl.pc.delay(2)
      >>> )
      >>> ...

      Note that the serial number *7FA50D00FFFF00DD* is that of the
      USB drive and *00023456* is the serial number of the USB-RLY8b
      board which implements the switching (in this case we use bank 0
      of relays, from 1 to 4).

    Example:

    An Arduino 101 is connected to a NUC mini-PC as a USB device using
    the *thing* interface that we can control from a script or command line:

    In this case we create an *interconnect* that wraps all the
    targets together (the Arduino 101, the NUC) to indicate they
    operate together and the configuration block would be::

      ttbl.config.interconnect_add(ttbl.test_target("usb__nuc-02__a101-04"),
                                  ic_type = "usb__host__device")
      ttbl.test_target.get('nuc-02').add_to_interconnect('usb__nuc-02__a101-04')
      ttbl.test_target.get('a101-04').add_to_interconnect('usb__nuc-02__a101-04')
      ttbl.test_target.get('nuc-02').thing_add('a101-04',
                                               ttbl.usbrly08b.plugger("00033085", 1))

    Where *00033085* is the serial number for the USB-RLY8b which
    implements the USB plugging/unplugging (in this case we use bank 1
    of relays, from 5 to 8)

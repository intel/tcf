Stream and snapshot capture interface
*************************************

This module implements an interface to capture things in the server
and then return them to the client.

This can be used to, for example:

-  capture screenshots of a screen, by connecting the target's output
   to a framegrabber, for example:

   - `MYPIN HDMI Game Capture Card USB 3.0
     <https://www.amazon.com/AGPTEK-Capture-Streaming-Recorder-Compatible/dp/B074863G59/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=MYPIN+HDMI+Game+Capture&qid=1556209779&s=electronics&sr=1-2-spons&psc=1>`_

   - `LKV373A <https://www.lenkeng.net/Index/detail/id/149>`_

   - VNC providers

   ...

   and then running somethig such as ffmpeg on its output

- capture a video stream (with or without audio) when the controller
  can say when to start and when to end (same above)

- capture network traffic with tcpdump

- sample power consumption data from PDUs that support it (eg:
  :class:`ttbl.raritan_emx.pci`)

A capturer is a driver, instance of :class:`ttbl.capture.impl_c` that
provides methods to start capturing and stop capturing. When a capture
is started, the driver returns a list of files where streams of data
are captured or being captured.

A snapshot providing only implements the start capture.

A driver captures one or more streams of data (most commonly the data
itself and a log of the capture process). In most cases, the capture
is done forking a process that does the work, forwarding all the
output to the log and the captured data to a file. If multiple files
are captured, each is mapped a *stream*.

Eg: if using ffmpeg to capture video from a screen:

 - *default* stream would have an AVI file with the video/audio
   capture

 - *log* stream would have the stdout and stderr of the ffmpeg
   program.

     - Type
       (str, bool, integer,
       float, dictionary)
     - Disposition
       (mandatory, recommended,
       optional[default])
     - Description

   * - interfaces.capture
     - Dictionary
     - Optional
     - Information about the different capturers available in the
       target; presence of this dictionary indicates the target
       supports data capture

   * - interfaces.capture
     - Dictionary
     - Optional
     - Information about the different capturers available in the
       target; presence of this dictionary indicates the target
       supports data capture

   * - interfaces.capture.NAME
     - Dictionary
     - mandatory
     - Descriptor for a capturer called *NAME*

   * - interfaces.capture.NAME.instrument
     - str
     - mandatory
     - Instrument that implements the capturer. This is described in
       the inventory entry *instrumentation.VALUE*

   * - interfaces.capture.NAME.snapshot
     - bool
     - mandatory
     - Indicates if this capturer is a snapshot or non-snapshot
       capturer. A snapshot capturer takes a single capture and
       returns the capture as set of streams. A non-snapshot capturer
       starts capturing and captures data until stopped and then
       returns the streams captured.

   * - interfaces.capture.NAME.capturing
     - bool
     - optional
     - Indicates if this capturer is currently capturing (applies only
       to non-snapshot capturers). If not present, it can be assumed
       to be *False*.

   * - interfaces.capture.NAME.stream.STREAMNAME
     - Dictionary
     - mandatory
     - Descriptor for each stream captured by *NAME*. The convention
       calls for the default stream to be called *default*, any
       diagnostics or logs to be called *logANYTHING*, others can be
       called anything that is a valid field name.

   * - interfaces.capture.NAME.stream.STREAMNAME.mimetype
     - Dictionary
     - mandatory
     - Indicates the MIME type of the data captured by a stream (eg:
       application/json, text/plain, video/avi...)

   * - interfaces.capture.NAME.stream.STREAMNAME.file
     - Dictionary
     - mandatory
     - When capturing or when having captured, this points to the name
       of a file containing the captured data. The user can download
       this data using the store interface from the location
       *capture/FILENAME*.

    **Lifecycle**

    When starting a capture, if the capturer is already capturing, it
    is stopped first and the previous capture is wiped. If trying to
    stop an snapshot capturer or a non-capturing capturer, nothing
    happens.

    Once capturing starts, inventory fields are set with the names of
    the files where the data is being downloaded (see :ref:`inventory
    <inventory_capture>`). The data can be downloaded at any time,
    even when the system is still capturing, and in this case it might
    be incomplete or partial. Only when stopped the data is guaranteed
    to be complete and properly terminated.

    When the targets are released, any captured data is wiped.

    Only allocation owner, creator or guests can access the captured
    data (FIXME: pending).

class generic_snapshot(impl_c):
    """This is a generic snaptshot capturer which can be used to invoke any
    program that will do capture a snapshot.

    For example, in a server configuration file, define a capturer
    that will connect to VNC and take a screenshot:

    >>> capture_screenshot_vnc = ttbl.capture.generic_snapshot(
    >>>     "%(id)s VNC @localhost:%(vnc_port)s",
    >>>     # need to make sure vnc_port is defined in the target's tags
    >>>     "gvnccapture -q localhost:%(vnc_port)s %(output_file_name)s",
    >>>     mimetype = "image/png"
    >>> )

    Then attach the capture interface to the target with:

    >>> ttbl.test_target.get('TARGETNAME').interface_add(
    >>>     "capture",
    >>>     ttbl.capture.interface(
    >>>         vnc0 = capture_screenshot_vnc,
    >>>         ...
    >>>     )
    >>> )

    (for a full VNC capturer see :func:`mk_capture_screenshot_vnc`)

    Now the command::

      $ tcf capture TARGETNAME vnc0

    will download to ``file.png`` a capture of the target's screen via
    VNC.

    :param str name: name for error messages from this capturer.

      E.g.: `%(id)s HDMI`

    :param str cmdline: commandline to invoke the capturing the
      snapshot.

      E.g.: `ffmpeg -i /dev/video-%(id)s`; in this case udev
      has been configured to create a symlink called
      */dev/video-TARGETNAME* so we can uniquely identify the device
      associated to screen capture for said target.

    :param str mimetype: MIME type of the capture output, eg image/png

    :param list pre_commands: (optional) list of commands (str_type) to
      execute before the command line, to for example, set parameters
      eg:

      >>> pre_commands = [
      >>>     # set some video parameter
      >>>     "v4l-ctl -i /dev/video-%(id)s -someparam 45",
      >>> ]

    Note all string parameters are `%(keyword)s` expanded from the
    target's tags (as reported by `tcf list -vv TARGETNAME`), such as:

    - stream_filename: name of the file where to dump the capture
      output in the capture/ subdirectory; file shall be overwritten.
    - log_filename: name of the file where we are capturing execution
      log in the capture/ subdirectory; file shall be overwritten.
    - id: target's name
    - type: target's type
    - ... (more with `tcf list -vv TARGETNAME`)

    **System configuration**

    It is highly recommendable to configure *udev* to generate device
    nodes named after the target's name, so make configuration simpler
    and isolate the system from changes in the device enumeration
    order.

    For example, adding to `/etc/udev/rules.d/90-ttbd.rules`::

      SUBSYSTEM == "video4linux", ACTION == "add", \
          KERNEL=="video*", \
          ENV{ID_SERIAL} == "SERIALNUMBER", \
          SYMLINK += "video-TARGETNAME"

    where *SERIALNUMBER* is the serial number of the device that
    captures the screen for *TARGETNAME*. Note it is recommended to
    call the video interface *video-SOMETHING* so that tools such as
    *ffmpeg* won't be confused.

    This is a generic stream capturer which can be used to invoke any

    For example, in a server configuration file, define a capturer

    to the target's monitor or an HDMI capturer:

    >>> capture_vstream_ffmpeg_v4l = ttbl.capture.generic_snapshot(

    Now, when the client runs to start the capture::

      $ tcf capture-start TARGETNAME hdmi0_vstream

    will execute in the server the pre-commands::

      $ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video-TARGETNAME-0 -c focus_auto=0

    and then start recording with::

      $ ffmpeg -i /dev/video-TARGETNAME-0 -f avi -qscale:v 10 -y SOMEFILE

    so that when we decide it is done, in the client::

      $ tcf capture-get TARGETNAME hdmi0_vstream file.avi

    it will stop recording and download the video file with the
    recording to `file.avi`.

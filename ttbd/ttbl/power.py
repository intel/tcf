Control power to targets and general control for relays, buttons and jumpers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This interface provides means to power on/off targets and the invidual
components that compose the power rail of a target.

The interface is implemented by :class:`ttbl.power.interface` needs to
be attached to a target with :meth:`ttbl.test_target.interface_add`::

>>> ttbl.test_target.get(NAME).interface_add(
>>>     "power",
>>>     ttbl.power.interface(
>>>         component0,
>>>         component1,
>>>         ...
>>>     )

Generally, this interface can also be used to control any
instrumentation that has binary states (on/off, true/false,
connected/disconnected, pressed/released, etc..) such as:

- relays
- buttons
- jumpers (controlled by a relay)

by convention, the *buttons* and *jumpers* interfaces are exposed with
those names; thus, in a configuration :ref:`configuration file
<ttbd_configuration>`::

>>> ttbl.test_target.get(NAME).interface_add(
>>>     "buttons",
>>>     ttbl.power.interface(
>>>         power = ttbl.usbrly08b.pc("24234", 3),
>>>         reset = ttbl.usbrly08b.pc("24234", 4),
>>>         ...
>>>     )

would add two buttons, power and reset, controlled by a
:class:`USBRLY08B <ttbl.usbrly08b.pc>` relay bank (by wiring the NO and
NC lines through the button so that turning on/closing the relay
effectively presses the button).

Any other mechanism (and driver) to act on jumpers or buttons can be
implemented to provide the on/off operation that translates into
button press/release or jumper close/open.

Each component is an instance of a subclass of
:class:`ttbl.power.impl_c`, which implements the actual control over
the power unit, such as:

- PDU socket: :class:`Digital Logger's Web Power Switch
  7<ttbl.pc.dlwps7>`, :class:`YKush <ttbl.pc_ykush.ykush>` power
  switch hub, raritan EMX
- relays: :class:`USB-RLY08b <ttbl.usbrly08b.pc>`
- control over IPMI: :class:`ttbl.ipmi.pci`

Also power components are able to:

- start / stop daemons in the server (*socat*, *rsync*, *qemu*,
  *openocd*...)

- :class:`delay <ttbl.pc.delay>` the power on/off sequence

- wait for some particular conditions to happen: a file
  :class:`dissapearing <ttbl.pc.delay_til_file_gone>` or
  :class:`appearing <ttbl.pc.delay_til_file_appears>`,
  :class:`a shell command running and returning a value
  <ttbl.power.delay_til_shell_cmd_c>` or a USB device is
  :class:`detected <ttbl.pc.delay_til_usb_device>` in the system

.. _ttbd_power_explicit:

Explicit vs normal power components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Power components can be declared as:

  - **normal** (default): upon running whole rail power **on** or
    **off** sequences, they are always acted upon.

  - **explicit**: upon running a whole rail power **on** or **off**
    sequence, they will be skipped, unless the *explicit* option is
    given.

  - **explicit/on**: upon running a whole rail power **on** sequence,
    they will be skipped unless the *explicit* option is given.

  - **explicit/off**: upon running a whole rail power **off**
    sequence, they will be skipped unless the *explicit* option is
    given.

Thus, an *explicit* power components will be only acted upon when we
explicitly power them on/off.

Use models for the *explicit* tagging:

- a target is powered by components A and B. Component A takes a
  long time to power up and can be left on, since the actual power
  control to the target depends on also on B being on and B is more
  responsive.

  Component A would be declared as *explicit off*.

  This can be applied for example to servers powered via a PDU for AC
  power but whose actual state can be governed via a BMC using the
  IPMI protocol.

- Invasive instrumentation C connected to a target that is to be used
  only in certain ocassions but has to be powered off for normal use.

  Component C would be declared as *explicit on*.

To configure a component at the configuration level, the :attr:impl_cexplicit
attribute can be set to:

- *None* for normal behaviour

- *both* explicit for both powering on and off

- *on* explicit for powering on

- *off* explicit for powering off

this can be used either in the intialization sequence or afterwards:

>>> pc = ttbl.power.socat_pc(ADDR1, ADDR2)
>>> pc.explicit = 'both'

.. _ttbd_power_states:

Overall power state and explicit power components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deciding what is the overall power state has a few nuances to take
into account, especially when explicit power components are taken into
account.

The target is:

- **fully on**: when **all** the power components (including those
  tagged as *explicit* and *explicit/on*) are reporting *on* or *n/a*

- *partial on*: when **all** the power components (excluding those
  tagged as *explicit* and *explicit/on*) reports *on* and some (but
  not all) of those tagged as *explict* and *explicit/on* are
  on.

  This might be an inconsistent state, since some of the explicit
  components might not allow the target to operate normally.

- **on**: when **all** the power components (except those tagged as
   **explicit** and **explicit/on**) are reporting *on* or *n/a*

- *partial off*: when **any** (but not all) power components
  (excluding those tagged as *explicit* and *explicit/on*) reports
  *off*

- *off*: when **all** power components (excluding those tagged as
  *explicit* and *explicit/off*) report *off*

- **fully off**: when **all** the power components (including those
  tagged as *explicit* and *explicit/off*) report *off*.

Note the computation of *is the target* off depends on the context:

- for a remote user:

  - *fully on* might be impossible to reach for operation of the
    target, as some explicit/on power components might not allow the
    target to work normally (eg: invasive instrumentation that disallows
    normal operation).

  - *partial on* like *fully on*, this might be an inconsistent state,
    since some of the explicit components might not allow the target
    to operate normally.

    This might be used for non-common circumnstances to administer,
    diagnose or do non typical work on the targets.

  - *on* means the target should operate as it'd be normally

  - *partial off* likely means the not everything the target needs to
    work is operative; to bring it to operation most likely it shall
    be power cycled (take to off, then power on).

  - *off* means the target is powered off as it'd be normally

  - *partial off* likely means the not everything the target needs to
    work is operative; to bring it to operation most likely it shall
    be power cycled (take to off, then power on).

- for a daemon powering off unused infrastructure, it should take to
  *off* anything on *partially off*, *on* and *fully on* and after a
  longer count, maybe bring to *fully off*.

As a convenience, the system publishes in the inventory the data
*interfaces.power.state* as *true* if *on*. Otherwise, the state is
not published and must be assumed as *off* or *fully off*.

    """Implementation interface to drive a  power component

    A power component is an individual entity that provides one of the
    pieces of a power rail needed to power up a target.

    It can be powered on, off and it's state can be acquired.

    A driver is made by subclassing this object, implementing the
    :meth:`on`, :meth:`off` and :meth:`get` methods and then adding
    it to a power interface :class:`ttbl.power.interface` which is
    then attached to a target.

    Drivers implement the specifics to run the switches PDUs, relays,
    etc

    Note these are designed to be as stateless as possible; in most
    cases all the state needed can be derived from the *target* and
    *component* parameters passed to the methods.

    Remember no information can be stored *self* or *target* as the
    next call can come in another daemon implementing the same
    target. For storage, use the target's *fsdb* interface.

    **ALL** the methods have to be blocking, so the operation is
    supposed to be completed and the status has to have been changed
    by the time the call returns. If the operation cannot be trusted
    to be blocking, set the *paranoid* parameter to *True* so the
    power interface will confirm the change has re-happened and
    enforce it again.

    :param bool paranoid: don't trust the operation is really
      blocking, as it should, so double check the state changed happen
      and retry if not.

    :param bool ignore_get: when reading the state, ignore it
      and return *None* (not available)--this is normally used for
      power components which we want to manipulate but not care for
      the state.

    :param bool ignore_get_errors: if reading the state causes an
      error, ignore and return *None* (not available)

    :param str explicit: (optional, default *None*) declare if this power
      component shall be only turned on or off when explicitly named in
      a power rail. See :ref:ttbd_power_explicit.

      - *None*: for normal behaviour; component will be
         powered-on/started with the whole power rail

      - *both*: explicit for both powering on and off: only
        power-on/start and power-off/stop if explicity called by
        name

      - *on*: explicit for powering on: only power-on/start if explicity
        powered on by name, power off normally

      - *off*: explicit for powering off: only power-off/stop if explicity
        powered off by name, power on normally

    :param bool off_on_release: (optional; default *False*) turn off
      when the target is released; this is normally use for components
      that implement some kind of access control that should not be
      used once a machine is released.

    """Driver to reset a device

    This driver resets a given device when the :meth`on` function is
    called; the reset is achieved by unbinding the device from it's
    driver and then rebinding it. In most cases, in Linux, this
    achieves a device reset.

    Note also that in general, most devices are *always* bound to a
    driver; the code finds the driver on its own.

    :param str device_path_or_spec: Path to device
      (/sys/bus/BUSNAME/devices/DEVICENAME) or device spec (see
      :class:`ttbl.device_resolver_c`)

    **System Setup**

    This will need write access to the *bind/unbind* files in
    `/sys/bus/*/drivers/*`.

    Normally the daemon is executed with *root* group, so the driver
    entries need *g+w* permission added. This is accomplished by a
    rule in /etc/rules.d/80-ttbd.rules (from
    tcf.git/ttbd/80-ttbd.rules).

    **Examples**

    >>> ttbl.power.device_reset_c("/sys/bus/usb/device/11-3.2")

    Note that to device a USB hub, it is important to ensure that:

    - all instrumentation for a target is in the same hub
    - pick the top level USB device for the hub, for example::

      expansion, where each field comes either from the *kws*

      line) Path to the binary to execute.

      .. warning:: this might be fully deprecated, since its use has
                   been taken over by *check_path*

    :param str check_path: (optional; defaults to *path*) binary path
      to use when checking if the process is alive.

      Some processes, after starting with a given binary, fork and
      transform into another (eg: */usr/bin/program1* forks into
      */usr/bin/program2* which runs for a long time). To check if the
      component is running, we check for the PID we are monitoring
      corresponding to */usr/bin/program2* instead of *program1*.

    :param str name: (optional) name of this component; defaults to
      the basename of the path to run.

      eg: if calling */usr/bin/somedaemon*, name would be *daemon*.

    :param bool mkpidfile: (optional; default *True*) create a pidfile
      when the process starts, using as name/template the value of
      *pidfile*.

    :param str pidfile: (optional) pidfile name (template); defaults
      to "PATH/COMPONENT-NAME.pid". *PATH* is the state directory for
      the given target (usually
      */var/lib/ttbd/instance/targets/TARGETNAME*). *COMPONENT* is the
      component under which this driver has been registered when
      adding to the interface. *NAME* is the name of this driver
      instance, see above.

    :param bool close_fds: (optional; default *True*) close or not all
      file descriptors before running the command; see
      :python:`subprocess.Popen` for more information.

      If set to *False*, you can select which file descriptors are
      kept open with:

      >>> os.setinheritable(FD, True)

    :param bool kill_before_on: (optional; default *True*) before
      starting the process, kill any possible process that is running
      with the same command line and if any, report it as a possible
      bug.

    :param str stderr_name: (optional) set a template for the name of
      the file that will contain the stderr for the daemon.

      Defaults to TARGETSTATEDIR/COMPONENT-NAME.stderr

      Can be set before calling :meth:`on`

    Other parameters as to :class:ttbl.power.impl_c.

    The *kws* member are keywords that can be used to expand the
    command line; before calling :meth:`on`, they'll be expanded with
    the target's keywords. This process is currently a wee messy,
    since it just brings the whole inventory and in most cases there
    is no need for all of it.

# derive daemon_c so we get verify()  and

class daemon_podman_container_c(daemon_c):
    """Run a daemon inside a Podman container

    A container is spun to execute a command (usually a long standing
    service provider) isolated from the main system

    >>> pc = ttbl.power.daemon_podman_container_c(
    >>>     "SOMENAME",
    >>>     cmdline = [
    >>>         "fedora:34",
    >>>         "/bin/ls", "-l",
    >>>     ]
    >>> )

    :param str name: name given to the container, will be
      passed to *podman run*

    :param list(str) cmdline: command line to add to *podman run* (see
      below); example:

    :param dict env_add: environment variables to add to the container
      (will be passed with *-e* to *podman run*).

    Other parameters as to :class:`ttbl.power.impl_c`.

    The container:

    - is run a child of the daemon process if not using *-d*, thus if
      the process is killed, the container is killed too.

    - a container name is composed by adding the target name and
      component to the *name* parameter to generate
      *TARGETNAME_COMPONENT_NAME*

    **Debugging**

    To find running containers, as *root* or user running the
    daemon, issue::

      $ podman ps
      CONTAINER ID  IMAGE   COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS                 PORTS                   NAMES
      c379aedfed4b          rpyc_classic --ho...  About a minute ago  Up About a minute ago  0.0.0.0:3003->3003/tcp  t0_aa0_SOMENAME

    To run a shell inside the container, run either::

      $ podman exec -ti c379aedfed4b /bin/bash
      $ podman exec -ti tt_aa0_SOMENAME /bin/bash

    **Configuration tips**

    In general, except for very basic configurations, you might need
    to subclass the container class to set container configurations.

    >>> class my_class(ttbl.power.daemon_container_c):
    >>>
    >>>     def __init__(self, myparams, **kwargs):
    >>>         ...verify and set myparams...
    >>>         ttbl.power.daemon_container_c.__init__(self, **kwargs)
    >>>         self.upid_set("LONG NAME", data1=val1, data2 = val2
    >>>
    >>>     def on(self, target, component):
    >>>         ...determine runtime info, set self.kws

    - *Add an image*: if you don't want to use / can use an image
      available on a registry (summary of
      https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/building-buildah) create a file
      called *image.Dockerfile* with::

        FROM centos:8
        RUN dnf install -y python36 usbutils strace
        RUN dnf clean all

      and run to create an image named *centos8python36*::

        $ buildah bud -f image.Dockerfile -t centos8python36
        $ podman run localhost/centos8python36 echo "I work"

      This then can be fed to the podman command line as
      *localhost/centos8python36*

      >>> cmdline = [
      >>>     ...,
      >>>     # these two have to be the last arguments
      >>>     "localhost/centos8python36",
      >>>     COMMANDTOEXECUTEINTHECONTAINER,
      >>>     ARG1, ARG2,...
      >>> ]

    - *Capturing output to consoles*: the output of the container is
      captured to a file called *COMPONENTNAME.stderr* in the target's
      state directory.

      It can be exposed as a console via the console interface by
      adding to the target object:

      >>> target.interface_impl_add(
      >>>     "console", "log_COMPONENTNAME",
      >>>     ttbl.console.logfile_c("COMPONENTNAME-CONTAINERNAME.stderr"))

    - *Exposing network ports*: the default container configuration
      allows the container to access the host network. To expose ports
      from inside the container in the host, specify the *--publish*
      command line option:

      >>> cmdline = [
      >>>     ...,
      >>>     "--publish", "PORT_HOST:PORT_CONTAINER",
      >>>     ...,
      >>> ]

    - *Exposing other host directories to the container*: using the
      container's *-v|--volume* option:

      >>> cmdline = [
      >>>     ...,
      >>>     # expose /opt/somedir as readonly from
      >>>     # /opt/somedir/*someversion* take *someversion* from self.kws
      >>>     "--volume=/opt/somedir/%(someversion)s:/opt/somedir:ro",
      >>>     # expose as readonly, take *someversion* from self.kws
      >>>     "--volume=/opt/somedir/%(someversion)s:/opt/somedir:ro",
      >>>     ...,
      >>> ]

      Some of the options to be added:

      - *rw* / *ro*: give read/write or read/only access

      - *O*: give overlay access (host is read only, container is
        read-write and changes get discarded when the container is
        destroyed)

      See *podman-run*'s man page for more information and other
      settings

    - *Exposing hardware devices*

      The container can access hardware devices, as long as:

      1. the user the daemon runs under has permission to access the
         device

      2. the container has to be given the right command lines to
         acces it (*--device*, *--volume*); for example, for passing
         access to a device, given its serial number, we need to find
         its */dev/usb/bus/BUSNUMBER/DEVICENUMBER* path and its
         */sys/bus/usb* path

         >>> cmdline = [
         >>>     ...,
         >>>
         >>>     "--device=%(device_path)s:%(device_path)s:rwm",
         >>>     "--volume=%(device_syspath)s:%(device_syspath)s",
         >>>     ...,
         >>> ]

         Those paths (*device_path* and *device_syspath*) are
         published in the *self.kws* in the *on* method, since they
         have to be found upon runtime:

         >>>     def on(self, target, component):
         >>>         ...
         >>>         syspath, busnum, devnum = ttbl.usb_device_by_serial(
         >>>             self.usb_serial_number, None, "busnum", "devnum"
         >>>         )
         >>>         if syspath == None or busnum == None or devnum == None:
         >>>             raise RuntimeError(
         >>>                 f"Cannot find USB device with serial {self.usb_serial_number}")
         >>>        ...
         >>>        self.kws = {
         >>>            # Keywords for mapping a USB device
         >>>            "device_path": f"/dev/bus/usb/{int(busnum):03d}/{int(devnum):03d}",
         >>>            "device_syspath": syspath,
         >>>            ...,
         >>>        }
         >>>        ttbl.power.daemon_podman_container_c.on(self, target, component)

         See example implementation at FIXME.

    3. Other command line additions:

       - *--restart*: restart on failure, note it might conflict with *--rm*

         >>>         cmdline = [
         >>>             ...,
         >>>             # "always" conflicts with --rm; this is enough to
         >>>             # restart when running in forking --mode (see below)
         >>>             # even adding :COUNT conflicts with --rm...hmm
         >>>             "--restart", "on-failure",
         >>>             ...,
         >>>        ]

       - *--cap-add*: if you need to debug

         >>>         cmdline = [
         >>>             ...,
         >>>             # allow strace for debugging and others etc
         >>>             "--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE",
         >>>             ...,
         >>>        ]



    **System Setup**

    This driver requires the podman package being installed in the
    server::

      $ sudo dnf install -y podman

    Ensure the user that runs the daemon has SUBUIDs::

      $ sudo usermod --add-subuids 10000-65536 --add-subgids 10000-65536 ttbd

      $ sudo -u ttbd podman system migrate
      $ sudo -u podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map
      0        991          1
      1      70000     100001
      $ FIXME

    **Troubleshooting**

    - If the container system for the user is all messed up, the
      username can be wiped up::

        $ sudo su - DAEMONUSER    # become the user that runs the daemon
        $ rm -rf ~DAEMONUSER/.{config,local/share}/containers
        $ rm -rf /run/user/DAEMONUSER/{libpod,runc,vfs-*}
        $ podman unshare rm -rf .{config,local/share}/containers

    **FIXME/PENDING**

    - use podman python library instead of shell

    - expose the container ID in
      interfaces.INFACENAME.COMPONENT.container_id when started

    """Expose a containeraized Python environment in the server to client via RPYC

    This driver is used to expose RPYC servers that that allows us to
    execute Python code in the server environment
    (https://rpyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

    When started, it starts a server in the server that listens on a
    TCP port (by default wrapped over SSL). The client then can
    connect to it and instantiate Python objects in the environment
    and call them / use them as if it was local. For example:

    >>> import rpyc
    >>> remote = rpyc.ssl_connect(HOSTNAME, PORTNUMBER)
    >>> with remote.builtins.open("somefile", "w") as f:
    >>>    f.write("hello")

    Creates a file *somefile* in the target environment.

    .. note: this can open security issues and to avoid such, this
             environment is by default run inside a rootless container
             using podman.

    The function :func:`tcfl.tl.rpyc_connect` returns a ready to use
    remote connection object given a target and the component name for the
    target (which is assumed in the *power* interface):

    >>> remote = tcfl.tl.rpyc_connect(target, "COMPONENTNAME")
    >>> remote_sys = remote.modules['sys']


    :param int port: TCP port in which to listen

    :param str host: (optional, default *0*--attach to all interfaces)

    :param bool ssl_enabled: (optional, default *True*) run all
      communication between RPYC client and server SSL encrypted.

      Uses the target-defined SSL Certificate Authority, certificates
      can be downloaded from the target with
      target.certs.get("CERTNAME")

    :param str venv_path: (optional, default *None*) Python Virtual
      Environment (venv) inside the container where to execute the
      RPYC server.

      Note that if the venv uses a diffferent python version than that
      of the container (eg: Python 3.6 vs Python 3.9), the RPYC server
      must be available inside said virtual environment and the path
      to it overriden in the *env_add* variable, e.g.:

      >>> ttbl.power.rpy_c(
      >>>     ...
      >>>     venv_path = "/some/venv",
      >>>     env_add = { 'RPYC_CLASSIC': "/some/venv/bin/rpyc_classic.py" },
      >>>     ...

    :param dict env_add: environment variables to add to the container
      (will be passed with *-e* to *podman run*).

      Note the path to the RPYC server will default to *rpyc_classic*
      but can be overriden by setting here the *RPYC_CLASSIC*
      environment variable:

      >>> ttbl.power.rpy_c(
      >>>     ...
      >>>     env_add = { 'RPYC_CLASSIC': "/some/venv/bin/rpyc_classic.py" },
      >>>     ...

    :param dict(str) data_files: (optional) files that will be created
      in the configuration directory mapped to the container's
      */etc/ttbd/data*.

      When this is powered on, :meth:`on` is executed; the files are
      then created and available inside the container at
      */etc/ttbd/data*.

      This is a dictionary keyed by file name (no subdirectories); the
      value is a string that will be written to the file; the string
      will be *%(FIELD)s* substituted against the :data:`kws` member
      which includes the target's inventory data and anything added to
      it.

    :param dict(str) run_files: (optional) files that will be created
      in the configuration directory mapped to the container's
      */etc/ttbd/run*.

      When this is powered on, :meth:`on` is executed; the files are
      then created and executed before running the RPYC server.

      This is meant for scripting. Note the *run_files* are created
      and executed after the data files, thus the run files can access
      them.

    The rest of the parameters are as to :class:`ttbl.power.daemon_podman_container_c`.

    System Setup
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

    **Server**

    Create a container image with the Aardvark PY library, RPYC and
    other utilities for debugging; generate a file called
    *aardvark_py.Dockefile* with the contents::

        FROM fedora-minimal
        RUN microdnf install -y crontabs usbutils strace python3-rpyc python3-rpyc
        RUN microdnf clean all
        RUN pip3 install --no-deps aardvark_py

    And setup the container image for Aardvark::

        $ buildah bud -f aardvark_py.Dockerfile -t aardvark_py

    You can also use, from the in a :ref:`server configuration file
    <ttbd_configuration>`, the helper to auto-generate a local image
    upon server initialization:

    >>> commonl.buildah_image_create("aardvark_py", ttbl.aardvark.dockerfile)

    Which will create the image if non-existant.

    Client:

      $ sudo dnf install -y python3-rpyc
      $ pip3 install --user rpyc        	# if not available

class socat_pc(daemon_c):
    """
    Generic power component that starts/stops socat as daemon

    This class is meant to be subclassed for an implementation passing
    the actual addresses to use.

    :param str address1: first address for socat; will be templated
      with *%(FIELD)s* to the target's keywords and anything added in
      :data:`daemon_c.kws`.
    :param str address2: second address for socat; templated as
      *address1*
    :param dict env_add: variables to add to the environment when
      running socat
    :param float precheck_wait: seconds to wait once starting before
      checking if the daemon is running; sometimes it dies after we
      check, so it is good to give it a wait.

    Other arguments as to :class:ttbl.power.impl_c.

    This object (or what is derived from it) can be passed to a power
    interface for implementation, eg:

    >>> ttbl.test_target.get('TARGETNAME').interface_add(
    >>>     "power",
    >>>     ttbl.power.interface(
    >>>         ttbl.power.socat_pc(ADDR1, ADDR2)
    >>>     )
    >>> )

    Upon power up, the *socat* daemon will be started, with it's
    current directory set to the target's state directory and a log
    file called after the component (*NAME-socat.log*). When powering
    off, the daemon is stopped.

    Anything coming of the *ipmitool's* *stderr* is sent to a file
    called *NAME-socat.stderr*.

    Specifying addresses is very specific to the usage that it is to
    be done of it, but for example:

    - ``PTY,link=console-%(component)s.write,rawer!!CREATE:console-%(component)s.read``

      creates a PTY which will pass whatever is written to
      ``console-COMPONENT.write`` to the second address and whatever
      is read from it to ``console-COMPONENT.read`` (!! serves like a
      bifurcator).

      Note you need to use *rawer* to ensure a clean pipe, otherwise
      the PTY later might add \\rs.

    - ``/dev/ttyS0,creat=0,rawer,b115200,parenb=0,cs8,bs1``

      opens a serial port and writes to it whatever is written to
      ``console-COMPONENT.write`` and anything that is read from the
      serial port will be appended to file ``console-COMPONENT.read``.

    - ``EXEC:'/usr/bin/ipmitool -H HOSTNAME -U USERNAME -E -I lanplus sol activate',sighup,sigint,sigquit``

      runs the program *ipmitool*, writes to *stdin* whatever is
      written to *console-COMPONENT.write* and whatever comes out of
      *stdout* is written to *console-COMPONENT.read*.

    Be wary of adding options such *crnl* to remove extra CRs (\\r)
    before the newline (\\n) when using to implement consoles. The
    console channels are meant to be completely transparent.

    For examples, look at :class:`ttbl.console.serial_pc` and
    :class:`ttbl.ipmi.sol_console_pc`.

    ** Catchas and Tricks for debugging **

    Sometimes it just dies and we are left wondering

    - prepend to *EXEC* *strace -fo /tmp/strace.log*, as in::

        EXEC:'strace -fo /tmp/strace.log COMMANDTHATDIES'

      find information in server's ``/tmp/strace.log`` when power
      cycling or enable top level calling under strace; it gets
      helpful.

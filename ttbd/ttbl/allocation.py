#  - if I release targets from a reservation, they need to be removed
#    from the group list, so it is not confusing in the listing when I
#    get/alloc-ls
#  - reject messages to carry a 40x code?
#  - each target allocation carries a max TTL per policy
#  - starvation control missing
#  - forbid fsdb writing to alloc fields
#  - check lock order taking, always target or allocid,target
#  * LRU caches needs being able to invalidate to avoid data

# This is a simple priority queue allocator; the resource(s) to be

# A user places a request for any of multiple targets by calling
# request().
#
# _run() implements the actual scheduler runs by calling _run_target()

# _run() is triggered by:

#  - a new request()
#
#  - an allocation deleted [allocdb.delete()]

#  - periodically by the maintenance() process, which is called from

Dynamic preemptable queue multi-resource allocator

Highest priority is 0, lowest priority is > 0

Preemption use cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use case 1: queue for target with no preemption enabled

  queue: N O:500 1:450 2:400 3:350

  new waiter is added, 500P, whole thing is set to have preemption on

  queue: P O:500 1:500P 2:450 3:400 4:350

- Use case 2: (builds on 1)

  during a maintenance run (or other reason), prio of 1 is boosted by
  50; preemption kicks in, kicks out O

  queue: O:550  2:450 3:400 4:350

# allocations across multiple servers for machines that are meant to
# work together in an execution.
#
# Example: a cluster of 100 machines itnerconnected by private networks
#
#  - each server has 10 machines, so we'd do 10 machine allocations
#    plus the network to 10 separate servers
#
#  - the client generates a UUID and includes it on all the allocation
#    requests
#
#  - the server drivers that configure the network, for example, use
#    the UUID to derive a tunnel ID and program all switches to
#    interconnect all the private networks with each other using the
#    tunnel ID.
#
#
# Allocation UUIDs can't be reused for a while, to avoid things
# lagging behind in the infrastrucvture that may not have been

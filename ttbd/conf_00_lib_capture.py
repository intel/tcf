Configuration API for capturing audio and video
-----------------------------------------------

These capture objects are meant to be fed to the capture interface
declaration of a target in the server, for example, in any server
configuration file you could have added a target and then a capture
interface can be added with:

.. code-block:: python

   ttbl.test_target.get('TARGETNAME').interface_add(
       "capture",
       ttbl.capture.interface(
           screen = "hdmi0_screenshot",
           screen_stream = "hdmi0_vstream",
           audio_stream = "front_astream",
           front_astream = capture_front_astream_vtop_0c76_161e,
           hdmi0_screenshot = capture_screenshot_ffmpeg_v4l,
           hdmi0_vstream = capture_vstream_ffmpeg_v4l,
           hdmi0_astream = capture_astream_ffmpeg_v4l,
       )
   )

This assumes we have connected and configured:

- an HDMI grabber to the target's HDMI0 output (see :data:`setup
  instructions <capture_screenshot_ffmpeg_v4l>`)

- an audio grabber to the front audio output (see :data:`setup
  instructions <capture_front_astream_vtop_0c76_161e>`).

to create multiple capture capabilityies (video and sound streams, and
screenshots) with specific names for the ouputs and aliases)

Note the audio capturers are many times HW specific because they
expose different audio controls that have to be set or queried.

import ttbl.capture


#: A capturer to take screenshots from a v4l device using ffmpeg
#:
#: Note the fields are target's tags and others specified in
#: :class:`ttbl.capture.generic_snapshot` and
#: :class:`ttbl.capture.generic_stream`.
#:
#: To use:
#:
#:  - define a target
#:
#:  - physically connect the capture interface to it and to the
#:    server
#:
#:  - Create a *udev* configuration so the capture device exposes
#:    itself as */dev/video-TARGETNAME-INDEX*.
#:
#:    This requires creating a *udev* configuration so that the v4l
#:    device gets recognized and an alias created, which can be
#:    accomplished by dropping a udev rule in */etc/udev/rules.d* such
#:    as::
#:
#:      SUBSYSTEM == "video4linux", ACTION == "add", \
#:          KERNEL=="video*", \
#:          ENV{ID_SERIAL_SHORT} == "SOMESERIALNUMBER", \
#:          SYMLINK += "video-nuc-01A-$attr{index}"
#:
#:    note some USB devices don't offer a serial number, then you
#:    can use a device path, such as::
#:
#:      ENV{ID_PATH} == "pci-0000:00:14.0-usb-0:2.1:1.0", \
#:
#:    this is shall be a last resort, as then moving cables to
#:    different USB ports will change the paths and you will have to
#:    reconfigure.
#:
#:    See :ref:`methods to find device information <find_usb_info>`
#:
#:  - add the configuration snippet::
#:
#:      ttbl.test_target.get(TARGETNAME).interface_add(
#:          "capture",
#:          ttbl.capture.interface(
#:              screen = "hdmi0_screenshot",
#:              screen_stream = "hdmi0_vstream",
#:              hdmi0_screenshot = capture_screenshot_ffmpeg_v4l,

Discover testcases in directories or files
==========================================

This module contains the logic for different drivers to be able to to
discover testcases in a number in different files.

A discovery agent object :class:`agent_c` is created to maintain the
discovery state; then :meth:`agent_c.run` executed to run the discovery
process. :data:`agent_c.tcis` will contain the information about found
testcases. 

The discovery process involves enumerating all possible files in the
paths passed as input and spawning a separate process for each (to
isolate from crashes, failures to import and other errors). When a
valid testcase is found, the process will be left as an execution
server that can launch testcases to execute. See :class:`agent_c` for
more details.

Quick usage:

>>> import tcfl.discovey
>>> tcfl.discovery.subsystem_setup()
>>> discovery_agent = tcfl.discovery.agent_c()
>>> discovery_agent.run(paths = [ "." ])
>>> print(discovery_agent.tcis)

    """Determine if a given file describes one or more testcases and
    crete them

    TCF's test case discovery engine calls this method for each
    file that could describe one or more testcases. It will
    iterate over all the files and paths passed on the command
    line files and directories, find files and call this function
    to enquire on each.

    This function's responsibility is then to look at the contents
    of the file and create one or more objects of type
    :class:`tcfl.tc.tc_c` which represent the testcases to be
    executed, returning them in a list.

    When creating :term:`testcase driver`, the driver has to
    create its own version of this function. The default
    implementation recognizes python files called *test_\\*.py* that
    contain one or more classes that subclass :class:`tcfl.tc.tc_c`.

    See examples of drivers in:

    - :meth:`tcfl.tc_zephyr_sanity.tc_zephyr_sanity_c.is_testcase`
    - :meth:`examples.test_ptest_runner` (:term:`impromptu
      testcase driver`)
    - (deprecated) Clear BBT (find historical in git logs, eg https://github.com/intel/tcf/commit/789812abcc057652e11ca31341f94e7c176f75f6)

    note drivers need to be registered with
    :meth:`tcfl.tc.tc_c.driver_add`; on the other hand, a Python
    :term:`impromptu testcase driver` needs no registration, but
    the test class has to be called *_driver*.

    :param str path: path and filename of the file that has to be
      examined; this is always a regular file (or symlink to it).

    :param str from_path: source command line argument this file
      was found on; e.g.: if *path* is *dir1/subdir/file*, and the
      user ran::

        $ tcf run somefile dir1/ dir2/

      *tcf run* found this under the second argument and thus:

      >>> from_path = "dir1"

    :param str tc_name: testcase name the core has determine based
      on the path and subcases specified on the command line; the
      driver can override it, but it is recommended it is kept.

    :param list(str) subcases_cmdline: list of subcases the user
      has specified in the command line; e.g.: for::

        $ tcf run test_something.py#sub1#sub2

      this would be:

      >>> subcases_cmdline = [ 'sub1', 'sub2']

    :returns: list of testcases found in *path*, empty if none
      found or file not recognized / supported.

    """
    Discovery agent to find testcases

    Given a list of paths (in arguments or manifest files), this scans
    those paths for files that might describe one or more testcases
    each according to one or more testcase drivers.

    A testcase driver is a subclass of :class:`tcfl.tc_c` whose
    :meth:`is_testcase` method knows how to find testcases in a file
    and when found, returns a list of :class:`tc_info_c`
    instances. This allows testcases to be written in any language,
    framework, etc since the driver class provides the adaptation
    layer for it.

    The discovery process for each file is run on a separate
    subprocess (to shield the caller from crashes, extra imports,
    collisions between testcases, etc). When the subprocess finds a
    file implements one or more valid subcases, it queues a message to
    the agent with a list of :class:`tc_info_c` instances, each
    definiting a testcase (containing info such as name, what kind of
    targets is needs, what axis, tags, description, etc).

    (PENDING) the per-file process then becomes an execution server
    that on command from the orchestrator can spawn testcases for
    execution.

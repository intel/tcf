"""
This module provides tools to image devices with a Provisioning OS.

The general operation mode for this is instructing the device to boot
the :term:`Provisioning OS <POS>`; at this point, the test script (or
via the *tcf* client line) can interact with the POS over the serial
console.

Then the device can be partitioned, formatted, etc with general Linux
command line. As well, we can provide an :mod:`rsync server
<ttbl.rsync>` to provide OS images that can be flashed

Booting to POS can be accomplished:

- by network boot and root over NFS
- by a special boot device pre-configured to always boot POS
- any other

Server side modules used actively by this system:

- DHCP server :mod:`ttbl.dhcp`: provides dynamic IP address
  assignment; it can be configured so a pre-configured IP address is
  always assigned to a target and will provide also PXE/TFTP boot
  services to boot into POS mode (working in conjunction with a HTTP,
  TFTP and NFS servers).

- rsync server :mod:`ttbl.rsync`: provides access to images to rsync
  into partitions (which is way faster than some other imaging methods
  when done over a 1Gbps link).

- port redirector :mod:`ttbl.socat`: not strictly needed for POS, but
  useful to redirect ports out of the :term:`NUT` to the greater
  Internet. This comes handy if as part of the testing external
  software has to be installed or external services acccessed.

Note installation in the server side is needed, as described in
:ref:`POS setup <pos_setup>`.

    root filesystem (:ref:`example <example_linux_kernel>`).

    A Linux kernel can be built and installed in a separate root
    directory in the following form::

      - ROOTDIR/boot/*
      - ROOTDIR/lib/modules/*

    all those will be rsync'ed to the target's */boot* and
    */lib/modules* (caching on the target's persistent rootfs area for
    performance) after flashing the OS image. Thus, it will overwrite
    whatever kernels where in there.

    The target's */boot/EFI* directories will be kept, so that the
    bootloader configuration can pull the information to configure the
    new kernel using the existing options.

    Build the Linux kernel from a *linux* source directory to a
    *build* directory::

      $ mkdir -p build
      $ cp CONFIGFILE build/.config
      $ make -C PATH/TO/SRC/linux O=build oldconfig
      $ make -C build all

    (or your favourite configuration and build mechanism), now it can
    be installed into the root directory::

      $ mkdir -p root
      $ make -C build INSTALLKERNEL=ignoreme \
          INSTALL_PATH=root/boot INSTALL_MOD_PATH=root \
          install modules_install

    The *root* directory can now be given to
    :func:`target.pos.deploy_image <tcfl.pos.extension.deploy_image>`
    as:

    >>> target.deploy_linux_kernel_tree = ROOTDIR
    >>> target.pos.deploy_image(ic, IMAGENAME,
    >>>                         extra_deploy_fns = [ tcfl.pos.deploy_linux_kernel ])

    or if using the :class:`tcfl.pos.tc_pos_base` test class template,
    it can be done such as:

    >>> class _test(tcfl.pos.tc_pos_base):
    >>>     ...
    >>>
    >>>     def deploy_00(self, ic, target):
    >>>         rootdir = ROOTDIR
    >>>         target.deploy_linux_kernel_tree = rootdir
    >>>         self.deploy_image_args = dict(extra_deploy_fns = [
    >>>             tcfl.pos.deploy_linux_kernel ])

    *ROOTDIR* can be hardcoded, but remember if given relative, it is
    relative to the directory where *tcf run* was executed from, not
    where the testcase source is.

    **Low level details**

    When the target's image has been flashed in place,
    :func:`tcfl.pos.deploy_image <tcfl.pos.extension.deploy_image>` is
    asked to call this function.

        rsync data from the local machine to a target

        The local machine is the machine executing the test script (where

        This function will first rsync data to a location in the target
        (persistent storage ``/persistent.tcd.d``) that will not be
        overriden when flashing images. Then it will rsync it from there
        to the final location.

        Note this cache directory can accumulate and grow too big;
        :func:`target.pos.deploy_image
        <tcfl.pos.extension.deploy_image>` will cap it to a top size
        by removing the oldest files.

        This allows the content to be cached in between testcase execution
        that reimages the target. Thus, the first run, the whole source
        tree is transferred to the persistent area, but subsequent runs
        will already find it there even when if the OS image has been
        reflashed (as the reflashing will not touch the persistent
        area). Of course this assumes the previous executions didn't wipe
        the persistent area or the whole disk was not corrupted.

        This function can be used, for example, when wanting to deploy
        extra data to the target when using :func:`deploy_image`:

        >>> @tcfl.tc.interconnect("ipv4_addr")
        >>> @tcfl.tc.target("pos_capable")
        >>> class _test(tcfl.tc.tc_c)

        >>>             extra_deploy_fns = [ self._deploy_mygittree ])
        >>>
        >>>     ...


        In this example, the user has a cloned git tree in
        ``~/somegittree.git`` that has to be flashed to the target into
        ``/opt/somegittree.git`` after ensuring the root file system is
        flashed with *Fedora 29*. :func:`deploy_image` will start the rsync
        server and then call *_deploy_mygittree()*  which will use
        :meth:`target.pos.rsync <rsync>` to rsync from the user's
        machine to the target's persistent location (in
        ``/mnt/persistent.tcf.d/somegittree.git``) and from there to the
        final location of ``/mnt/opt/somegittree.git``. When the system
        boots it will be of course in ``/opt/somegittree.git``

        Because :meth:`target.pos.rsyncd_start <rsyncd_start>`
        has been called already, we have now these keywords available
        that allows to know where to connect to.

          <rsyncd_start>` on the target. Functions such as

          different root partitions that are available, trying to select
          the one that has the most similar to what we are installing to
          minimize the install time.

    This basic template deploys an image specified in the environment
    variable ``IMAGE`` or in *self.requested_image*, power cycles into
    it and waits for a prompt in the serial console.

    This forcefully declares this testcase needs:

    - a network that supports IPv4 (for provisioning over it)
    - a target that supports Provisioning OS

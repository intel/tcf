        - *soft*: flash in soft mode (default *False) (see
          :meth:`target.images.flash
          <tcfl.target_ext_images.extension.flash>`) the image(s) will
          only be flashed if the image to be flashed is different than the
          last image that was flashed.

        - *upload*: flash in soft mode (default *True*) (see
          :meth:`target.images.flash
          <tcfl.target_ext_images.extension.flash>`). The file will be
          uploaded to the server first or it will be assumed it is already

          *IMAGETYPE*; *IMAGETYPE* being any of the image
          destinations the target can flash; can be found with::

            $ tcf image-ls TARGETNAME

          or from the inventory::

            $ tcf get TARGETNAME -p interfaces.images

          Note that the specification can include strings *%(FIELD)s* to be
          replaced by values extracted from the inventory and
          formatted using Python % formatting. This resolution will
          recurse up to five times (eg: if string *some-%(FIELD1)s* resolves
          into *some-thing-%(FIELD2)s* and expansion of *FIELD2*
          yields *some-thing-nice*).

        - environment *IMAGE_FLASH_<TYPE>*

        - environment *IMAGE_FLASH_<FULLID>*

        - environment *IMAGE_FLASH_<ID>*

        - environment *IMAGE_FLASH*

        With *TYPE*, *FULLID* and *ID* sanitized to any character outside
        of the ranges *[a-zA-Z0-9_]* replaced with an underscore (*_*).

        **Example**

        ::

          $ export IMAGE_FLASH_TYPE1="soft bios:path/to/bios.bin"
          $ tcf run test_SOMESCRIPT.py

        if *test_SOMESCRIPT.py* uses this template, every invocation of it
        on a machine of type TYPE1 will result on the file
        *path/to/bios.bin* being flashed on the *bios* location (however,
        because of *soft*, if it was already flashed before, it will be
        skipped).

        :return: a tuple of

          >>> ( DICT, UPLOAD, SOFT )

            >>>     IMGTYPE1: IMGFILE1,
            >>>     IMGTYPE2: IMGFILE2,
            >>>     ...
            >>> }

          - *UPLOAD*: boolean indicating if the user wants the files to be
            uploaded (*True*, default) or to assume they are already in
            the server (*False*).

          - *SOFT*: flash in soft mode (*True*) or not (*False*, default

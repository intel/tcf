"""TCF's backbone test case finder and runner
------------------------------------------

This implements a high level test case finder and runner to find and
execute test cases.

The execution of each test case consists of the following phases:

 - configure
 - build
 - target acquisition
 - deploy
 - one or more evaluation sequences
   (each consisting of setup, start, evaluation per se, teardown)
 - clean [not executed by default]

the configuration, build and deployment phases happen in the local
host; the evaluation phases can happen in the local host (for static
tests) or in remote targets (for dynamic tests).

The backbone is designed so multiple drivers (test case drivers) can
be implemented that find test cases and specify to the backbone how to
build, run and test for success or failure. This is done by
subclassing :class:`tcfl.tc.tc_c` and extending or redefining
:meth:`tc_c.is_testcase`.

Testcases are defined also by subclassing :class:`tcfl.tc.tc_c` and
implementing the different methods the meta runner will call to
evaluate. Testcases can manipulate targets (if they need any) by using
the APIs defined by :class:`tcfl.tc.target_c`.

The runner will collect the list of available targets and determine
whih testcases have to be run on which targets, and then create an
instance of each testcase for those groups of targets where it has to
run. All the instances will then be run in parallel throgh a
multiprocessing pool.

To testcases report results via the report API, which are handled by
drivers defined following :class:`tcfl.tc.report_driver_c`, which can
be subclassed and extended to report to different destinations
according to need. Default drivers report to console and logfiles.

.. _tc_id:

Testcase run identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A message identification mechanism for which all the messages are
prefixed with a code:

[RUNID:]HASH{CBDEL}[XX][.N]

- RUNID is a constant string to identify a run of a set of test cases
  (defaults to nothing, can be autogenerated with `-i` or an specific
  string given with `-i RUNID`).

- HASH is a base32 encoded hash of the testcase name, targets where it
  is to be run and their :term:`BSP model`.

- CBDEL is one capital letter representing the phase being ran
  (Configure, Build, Deploy, Evaluation, cLean)

- [XX]: base32 encoded hash of the BSP name, applies only to dynamic
  test case builds per BSP.

This helps locating anything specific to a testcase by grepping in the
logfile for a given string and adding more components restricts the
output.

This means that the message IDs are stable across runs, save RUNIDs
being specified.

We also use the RUNID:TC combination for a ticket when requesting a
target lock--note this does not conflict with other users, as the
tickets are namespaced per-user. This allows the server log to be used
to crossreference what was being ran, to sort out issues.

The *hash* length (number of characters used) is controlled by
:data:`tcfl.tc.tc_c.hashid_len`.

        might have to be added to those BSPs to make sure their CPUs
        are not going wild. Use this function to specify which app
        builder is going to be used, the path to the stub source and
        build options. The App building mechanism will take it from
        there.

        An app builder might determine that a given BSP needs no stub;
        in said case it can remove it from the dict
        :py:meth:`bsps_stub` with:

        >>> del target.bsps_stub[BSPNAME]

        This is like the app information added by _target_app_add(),
        but it is stored in the target_c instance, not to the testcase
        class.

        This is because the stubbing that has to be done is specific
        to each target (as the BSPs to stub each target have might be
        different depending on the target and BSP-model).

        Note this information is only added if there is nothing
        existing about said BSP. To override, you need to delete and
        add:

        >>> del target.bsps_stub[BSPNAME]
        >>> target.stub_app_add(BSPNAME, etc etc)

    Of those optional arguments, the most important are the app_*

    can be built or not. FIXME make this explanation better.

      filter against the tags the remote target exposes.

    :param str name: name for the target (must not exist already). If
      none, first declared target is called *target*, the next
      *target1*, then *target2* and so on.

    :param int count: (optional, default 1) number of targets to
      allocate; if more than one, targets will be called *target*,
      *target1*, *target2*, following the count of targets assigned to
      the testcase.

    :param dict kwargs: extra keyword arguments are allowed, which
      might be used in different ways that are still TBD. Main ones
      recognized:

       - *app_NAME = dict(BSP1: PATH1, BSP1: PATH2)*: specify a list
         of paths to apps that shall be built and deployed to the
         given BSPs by App builder *app_NAME*; App builders exist for
         Zephyr, Arduino Sketch and other setups, so you don't
         manually have to build your apps. You can create your own
         too.

         When a board is being run in a multiple BSP mode, each BSP
         has to be added to an App builder if using the App builder
         support, otherwise is an error condition.

       - *app_NAME = PATH*: the same, but one for when one BSP is
         used; it applies to `any` BSP in a single :term:`BSP model`
         target.

         FIXME: add link to app builders

       - *app_NAME_options = STRING*: Extra options to pass to the APP
          builder FIXME: support also BSP_options?

       .. _tcf_target_modes:

       - *mode*: how to consider this target at the time of generating
          multiple permutations of targets to run a testcase:

          - *any*: run the testcase on any target that can
            be found to match the specification

          - *one-per-type*: run the testcase on one target of each
            type that meets the specification (so if five targets
            match the specification but they are all of the same type,
            only one will run it; however, if there are two different
            types in the set of five, one of each type will run it)

          - *all*: run on every single target that matches the
            specification

         Specially on testcases that require multiple targets, there
         can be a huge number of permutations on how to run the
         testcase to ensure maximum coverage of different combinations
         of targets; some experimentation is needed to decide how to
         tell TCF to run the testcase and balance how many resources
         are used.

    .. note:: the :meth:`poll` and :meth:`detect` methods will be
              called in a loop until all the expectations have been
              detected.

              It is recommended that internal state is only saved in
              the *buffers* and *buffers_poll* storage areas provided
              (vs storing inside the object).

    :param tcfl.tc.target_c target: target on which this expectation
      is operating.

    :param float poll_period: how often this data needs to be polled
      in seconds (default *1s*).

    :param int timeout: maximum time to wait for this expectation;
      raises an exception of type *raise_on_timeout* if the timeout is
      exceeded. If zero (default), no timeout is raised, which
      effectively treats an expectation as optional or along with
      *raise_on_found* above, to raise an exception if an expectation
      is to be associated with an error condition.

    :param tcfl.tc.exception raise_on_timeout: (optional) a *type*
      (**not an instance**) to throw when not found before the
      timeout; a subclass of :class:`tcfl.tc.exception`.

    :param tcfl.tc.exception raise_on_found: an *instance* (**not a
      type**) to throw when found; this is useful to implement errors,
      such as *if I see this image in the screen, bail out*:

      >>> self.expect("wait for boot",
      >>>             crash = target.capture.image_on_screenshot(
      >>>                 'screen', 'icon-crash.png',
      >>>                 raise_on_found = tcfl.tc.error_e("Crash found"),
      >>>                 timeout = 0),
      >>>             login_prompt = target.capture.image_on_screenshot(
      >>>                 'screen', 'canary-login-prompt.png',
      >>>                 timeout = 4),

      >>>                 name = "login prompt",
      >>>             ),
      >>> )

      Note you need to tell it also *zero* timeout, otherwise it will
      complain if it didn't find it.

      The exception's attachments will be updated with the dictionary
      of data returned by the expectation's :meth:`detect`.

    :param str origin: (optional) when reporting information about
      this expectation, what origin shall it list, eg:

      - *commonl.origin_get(2)* also to get the current caller

    A testcase, with instructions for configuring, building, deploying,
    setting up, running, evaluating, tearing down and cleaning up.

    Derive this class to create a testcase, implementing the different
    testcase methods to build, deploy and evaluate if it is considered
    a pass or a failure:

    >>> class sometest(tcfl.tc.tc_c):
    >>>
    >>>     def eval_device_present(self):
    >>>          if not os.path.exists("/dev/expected_device"):
    >>>              raise tcfl.tc.error_e("Device not connected")

    >>>          if s.st_mode & 0x644 == 0:
    >>>              raise tcfl.tc.failed_e("wrong mode")

    .. note:: the class will be ignored as a testcase if its name
              starts with *_base_*; this is useful to create common
              code which will be instantiated in another class without
              it being confused with a testcase.

    :param str name: the name of the testcase
    :param str tc_file_path: the path to the file where the testcase
      was found
    :param str origin: the origin of the testcase (in most cases this
      is a string *FILENAME:LINE*)

    Note that in the most cases, the three arguments will be the same,
    as the name of the testcase will be the same as the path where the
    test case is found and if there is only one testcase per file, the
    origin is either line 1 or no line.

    When a file contains specifies multiple testcases, then they can
    be created such as:

     - name TCFILEPATH#TCCASENAME
     - tc_file_path TCFILEPATH
     - origin TCFILEPATH:LINENUMBER (matching the line number where
       the subcase is specified)

    this allows a well defined namespace in which cases from multiple
    files that are run at the same time don't conflict in name.

    The runner will call the testcase methods to evaluate the test;
    any failure/blockage causes the evaluation to stop and move on to
    the next testcase:

    - *configure\*()* for getting source code, configuring a buid,
      etc ..

    - *build\*()* for building anything that is needed to run the
      testcase

    - *deploy\*()* for deploying the build products or artifacts
      needed to run the testcase to the diffrent targets

    - For evaluating:

      - *setup\*()* to setup the system/fixture for an evaluation run
      - *start\*()* to start/power-on the targets or anything needed
        for the test case evaluation
      - *eval\*()* to actually do evaluation actions
      - *teardown\*()* for powering off

      As well, any *test\*()* methods will be run similarly, but for
      each, the sequence called will be setup/start/test/teardown (in
      contrast to *eval* methods, where they are run in sequence
      without calling setup/start/teardown in between).

    - *clean\*()* for cleaning up (ran only if *-L* is passed on the
      command line)

    - *class_teardown* is mostly used for self-testing and debugging,
       but are functions called whenever every single testcase of the
       same class has completed executing.

    Methods can take no arguments or the names of one or more targets
    they will operate with/on. These targets are declared using the
    :func:`tcfl.tc.target` (for a normal target) and
    :func:`tcfl.tc.interconnect` (for a target that
    interconnects/groups the rest of the targets together).

    The methods that take no targets will be called sequentially in
    **alphabetical order** (not in declaration order!). The methods
    that take different targets will be called in parallel (to
    maximize multiple cores, unless decorated with
    :func:`tcfl.tc.serially`). Evaluation functions are always called
    sequentially, except if decorated with :func:

    The testcase methods use the APIs exported by this class and module:

     - to report information at the appropiate log level:
       :meth:`reporter_c.report_pass`, :meth:`reporter_c.report_fail`,
       :meth:`reporter_c.report_blck` and :meth:`reporter_c.report_info`

     - raise an exception to indicate result of this method:

       - *pass*, raise :py:exc:`tcfl.tc.pass_e` (or simply return)
       - *failed*, raise :py:exc:`tcfl.tc.failed_e`,
       - *error*, raise :py:exc:`tcfl.tc.error_e`,
       - *blocked*, raise :py:exc:`tcfl.tc.blocked_e`; any other
         uncaught Python exception is also converted to this.
       - *skipped*, raise :py:exc:`tcfl.tc.skip_e`

     - run commands in the local machine with :meth:`shcmd_local`; the
       command can be formatted with *%(KEYWORD)[sd]* that will be
       substituted with values found in :attr:`kws`.

     - Interact with the remote targets through instances of
       :class:`target_c` that represent them:

       - via arguments to the method
       - via :attr:`targets`, a dictionary keyed by the names of the
         targets requested with the :func:`target` and
         :func:`interconnect` decorators; for example:

         >>> @tcfl.tc.interconnect()	# named "ic" by default
         >>> @tcfl.tc.target()		# named "target1" by default
         >>> @tcfl.tc.target()		# named "target" by default

        This is a generalization of the pattern *expect this string in
        a serial console* where we can wait, in the same loop for many
        things (expectations) from multiple sources such as serial
        console, screen shots, network captures, audio captures, etc...

        Each expectation is an object that implements the
        :class:`expectation_c` interface which indicates how to:

         - poll from a data source

         - detect what we are expecting in the polled data

         - generate collateral for said detected data

        This function will enter into a loop, polling the different
        expectation data sources according to the poll periods they
        establish, then detecting data and reporting the results back
        to the user and raising exceptions if so the user indicates want
        (eg: raise an exception if timeout looking for a shell prompt,
        or raise an exception if a *kernel panic* string is found).

        For example:

        >>> self.expect(
        >>>     name = "waiting for desktop to boot",
        >>>     timeout = 30,
        >>>     text_on_console(target, "Kernel Panic",
        >>>                     name = "kernel panic watchdog",
        >>>                     raise_on_found = tcfl.tc.error_e(
        >>>                         "Kernel Panic found!"),
        >>>     image_on_screenshot(target, 'screen', 'icon-power.png'),
        >>>     config_button = image_on_screenshot(target, 'screen',
        >>>                                         'icon-config.png')
        >>> )

        The first expectation will be called *kernel panic watchdog*
        and will raise an exception if the console print a
        (oversimplified for the sake of the example) kernel panic
        message. If not found, nothing happens.

        The second will default to be called whatever the
        :class:`target.capture.image_on_screenshot
        <tcfl.target_ext_capture.extension.image_on_screenshot>`
        calls it (*icon-power.png*), while the second will have it's
        name overriden to *config_button*. These last two will capture
        an screenshot from the target's screenshot capturer called
        *screen* and the named icons need to be found for the call to
        be succesful. Otherwise, error exceptions due to timeout will
        be raised.

        The list of expectations that will be always scanned is in
        this order:

        - testcase's global list of expectations (add with
          :meth:`expect_global_append`)

        - testcase's thread specific list of expectations (add with
          :meth:`expect_tls_append`)

        - list of expectations in the arguments

        :param expectation_c exps_args: expectation objects which are
          expected to be self-named (their implementations will assign
          names or a default will be given). eg:

          >>> self.expect(tcfl.tc.tc_c.text_on_console(args..etc),
          >>>             tcfl.tc.tc_c.image_on_screenshot(args..etc))

        :param expectation_c exps_kws: expectation objects named after
          the keyword they are assigned to; note the keywords *name*
          and *timeout* are reserved. eg:

          >>> self.expect(
          >>>     shell_prompt = tcfl.tc.tc_c.text_on_console(args..etc),
          >>>     firefox_icon = tcfl.tc.tc_c.image_on_screenshot(args..etc)
          >>> )

        :param int timeout: Maximum time of seconds to wait for all
          non-optional expectations to be met.

          >>> timeout = 4

         if no timeout is given it is taken from a testcase specific
         default stored int he thread specific variable
         ``testcase.tls.expect_timeout`` (60s).

        :param str name: a name for this execution, used for reporting
          and generation of collateral; it defaults to a test-specific
          monotonically increasing number shared amongst all the
          threads running in this testcase. eg:

          >>> name = "shell prompt received"

        :param str origin: (optional) when reporting information about
          this expectation, what origin shall it list, eg:

          - *None* (default) to get the current caller
          - *commonl.origin_get(2)* also to get the current caller
          - *commonl.origin_get(1)* also to get the current function

          or something as:

          >>> "somefilename:43"

        If no expectations are given, then this just waits the given
        timeout. Likewise, if all the individual expectations are
        given with *timeout = 0* (meaning if we don't get it, it is ok
        too), this will wait the given timeout.

        TCF's test case discovery engine calls this method for each
        file that could describe one or more testcases. It will
        iterate over all the files and paths passed on the command
        line files and directories, find files and call this function
        to enquire on each.

        This function's responsibility is then to look at the contents
        of the file and create one or more objects of type
        :class:`tcfl.tc.tc_c` which represent the testcases to be
        executed, returning them in a list.

        When creating :term:`testcase driver`, the driver has to
        create its own version of this function. The default
        implementation recognizes python files called *test_\*.py* that
        contain one or more classes that subclass :class:`tcfl.tc.tc_c`.

        See examples of drivers in:

        - :meth:`tcfl.tc_clear_bbt.tc_clear_bbt_c.is_testcase`
        - :meth:`tcfl.tc_zephyr_sanity.tc_zephyr_sanity_c.is_testcase`
        - :meth:`examples.test_ptest_runner` (:term:`impromptu
          testcase driver`)

        note drivers need to be registered with
        :meth:`tcfl.tc.tc_c.driver_add`; on the other hand, a Python
        :term:`impromptu testcase driver` needs no registration, but
        the test class has to be called *_driver*.

          *tcf run* found this under the second argument and thus:

          has specified in the command line; e.g.: for::

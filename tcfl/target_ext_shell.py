"""Run commands a shell available on a target's serial console
-----------------------------------------------------------

Shell prompts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Waiting for a shell prompt is quite a harder problem that it seems to
be at the beginning.

Problems:

- Background processes or (in the serial console, the kernel) printing
  lines in the middle.

  Even with line buffered output, when there are different CRLF
  conventions, a misplaced newline or carriage return can break havoc.

  As well, if a background process / kernel prints a message after the
  prompt is printed, a ``$`` will no longer match. The ``\\Z`` regex
  operator cannot be used for the same reason.

- CRLF conventions make it harder to use the ``^`` and ``$`` regex
  expression metacharacteds.

- ANSI sequences, human doesn't see/notice them, but to the computer /
  regular expression they are

Thus, resorting to match a single line is the best bet; however, it is
almost impossible to guarantee that it is the last one as the multiple
formats of prompts could be matching other text.

Fixups
^^^^^^

Some shells need to deal with output from background processes that
interrupts the shell; fixups provide a way to deal with it by
recognizing that output, reporting it and continuing typing.

For hard coding into the inventory, add to the inventory keys such
as::

  shell.fixups.CONTEXTNAME.NAME: PYTHONREGEXPATTERN

For coding in the tescase:

  >>> target.kws['shell']['fixups'][CONTEXTNAME][NAME] = PYTHONREGEXPATTERN

Where *CONTEXTNAME* is the name of a shell :ref:`context
<shell_c.context>` where this fixup will apply, *NAME* is a name that
will be used for reporting when *PYTHONREGEXPATTERN* is found in the
output (which is this is a Python regex pattern).

For each, a fixup object will be created when the shell is moved to
use the right context.

When found while typing a command, the :ref:`fixup <shell_c.fixup_c>`
object will detect it, report the occurrence of the output and then
keep typing whichever command was being typed halfway.

          (defaults to *None*, the default console).
        :param str origin: (optional) when reporting information about
          this expectation, what origin shall it list, eg:

          - *None* (default) to get the current caller
          - *commonl.origin_get(2)* also to get the current caller
          - *commonl.origin_get(1)* also to get the current function

          or something as:

          >>> "somefilename:43"

        :returns str:

          - if ``output`` is false, and *expectation* was not set,
            then returns *None*

            if an *expectation* was set, then the return value is that
            of matching the expectation; for example, if the
            expectation was  *re.compile(

            >>> r = target.shell.run(
            >>>     f"ping -n 5 192.168.1.1",
            >>>     re.compile("(?P<packet_loss>[\.0-9]+)% packet loss"))

            the return value will be the result of matching the
            regular expression, something like::

              {
                  'command output': {
                      'console output': ...,
                      'target': <tcfl.tc.target_c object at 0x7f92ea1c7250>,
                      'console': 'serial0',
                      'pattern': b'(?P<packet_loss>[\.0-9]+)% packet loss',
                      'groupdict': {'packet_loss': b'0'},
                      'offset': 4096,
                      'offset_match_start': 4870,
                      'offset_match_end': 4880
                  }
              }

             the matched values will be in the *groupdict* dictionary;
             this is what is returned by the *re* matching engine for
             the regular expressions passed in the expectation/s.

          - if ``output`` is true, a string with the output of the command.

          .. warning:: if ``output_filter_crlf`` is False, this output
             will be ``\\r\\n`` terminated and it will be confusing because
             regex won't work right away. A quick, dirty, fix

             >>> output = output.replace('\\r\\n', '\\n')

             ``output_filter_crlf`` enabled replaces this output with

             >>> output = output.replace('\\r\\n', target.console.crlf[CONSOLENAME])

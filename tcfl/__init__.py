    """Describe a Remote Target Server.

    Historically this was called *rtb*, meaning *Remote Target
    Broker*-- in many areas of the client code you will see *rtb* and
    *rt* for remote target.

    - Constructor is very simple on purpose, so we can just use it to
      store a pointer to a server without doing network access. All it
      does is validate the URL

    - :meth:`create` <- _url_servers_add(), creates one or more server
      objects from a URL/hostname.

    - :meth:`setup` has to be called before it's used to gather state

    - :meth:`discover` is a high level process used to discover
       servers (querying the network and servers for other servers)

    .. _tcf_discovery_process:

    Server discovery process
    ========================

    This process helps to discover all the servers available in an
    infrastructure with minimum configuration on the client side (ideally
    none).

    This relies on the following assumptions:

    - the servers describe other servers they know about (herd data)
      without login in

    - the servers can trust each other

    - the number of servers might be very high >100s

    - multiple clients and threads might be doing this in parallel;
      the database for caching has to be low

    The client starts the discovery process via a set of seed URLs, that
    come from:

    - the command line and environment

    - entries provided in the :ref:`client configuration files
      <tcf_client_configuration>`

      >>> tcfl.server_c.seed_add("https://myserver.domain:1234")
      >>> tcfl.server_c.seed_add("plainhostname")

    - load cached entries from previous runs (~/.cache/tcf/servers)

    - default seed URL *http://ttbd*; thus, the sysadmin of the local
      network can create a DNS CNAME that points to one or more DNS
      address records representing servers.

    Upon start, the client:

    1. (in parallel) queries each seed URL for their herd dara

    2. parses the herd data for each seed URL, extract the URLs in there,
       recording them all in a list of all URLs; return the new ones as a
       new list of seed URLs

    3. repeats process 1 and 2 with the new list of seed URLs until no more
       new servers are returned for a couple of times.

    Currently, :func:`tcfl.config.setup` calls
    :func:`tcfl.server_discover` which is seeded from URLs added with
    :meth:`tcfl.config.url_add`, command line


    Herd data published by the servers
    ----------------------------------

    When a server has a target called *local*, it is meant to describe the
    server itself and in its inventory it may have a :term:`herd` definition
    section specified :ref:`below <inventory_server_herds>`, which in
    summary looks like::

      $ tcf ls -avv SERVER_AKA/local | grep herds
      SERVER_AKA/local.herds...
      SERVER_AKA/local.herds.HERDNAME1.ID1.url: http://somehost:4323
      SERVER_AKA/local.herds.HERDNAME1.ID1.instance: INSTANCENAME
      SERVER_AKA/local.herds.HERDNAME1.ID2.url: http://somehost.somedomain:5000
      SERVER_AKA/local.herds.HERDNAME1.ID3.url: http://host34.domain.com:5000
      ...
      SERVER_AKA/local.herds.HERDNAME3.ID3.url: http://host34.sweet.com:5000

    The sever also publishes this information in the http://HOSTNAME/ttb
    endpoint with no login required.

    How this information is provisioned into the different servers is left
    to the user/admins, but it can be set from the command line with::

      $ tcf property-set SERVER_AKA/local herds.HERDNAME1.ID1.url http://somehost:4323
      $ tcf property-set SERVER_AKA/local herds.HERDNAME1.ID2.url http://somehost.somedomain:5000

    or via scripting using the :meth:`target.property_set
    <tcfl.tc.target_c.property_set>` call.

      other bad conditions (bad responses) refuse them

    - fix reporting list tcfl.config.urls -> used in report to jinja2,
      move to use tcfl.server_c.servers

    - replace tcfl.ttb_client.rest_target_broker with tcfl.server_c

    - as soon as we call a server good, start reading its inventory
      in the background

    - if cached, don't query from network until XYZ old?

        Discover servers

        Given a list of seed servers, use them to discover more servers
        on the network.

        The seed server list comes from:

        - resolving a hardcoded list of hostnames/URLs (that defaults
          to *ttbd*) and others added with
          :func:`tcfl.server_c.seed_add()` in configuration files

          >>> tcfl.server_c.seed_add("https://myserver.domain:1234")
          >>> tcfl.server_c.seed_add("plainhostname")

        - any server already initialized

        - hosts for which we have cached information

        This tries a few times (controlled by *loops_max*) to query
        each known server for more servers and gives up if it can't
        get more server twice. If a run provides more servers, on the
        next run those new servers will be query for others not yet
        known.

        Any bad server is removed from the list so we don't waste time
        on it.

        This is normally called by the *TCFL* library initialization
        sequence and the user does not need to worry about it.

        :param str seed_url: (optional; default *ttbd*) URL
          (or list of URLs) for a server (which to use for finding more
          servers).

          A good practice is to create a CNAME or a RECORD FOR
          *ttbd.DEFAULTDOMAIN* that points to one or more servers in your
          organization, so clients don't have to do any further server
          configuration.

    """
    Describe a target that is needed for a testcase

    :param str role: name of this target's role (eg: *server*,
      *client*); for most simple cases that only need one target it is
      *target*. If it is a network, then *network* or *ic* (interconnect).

    :param str origin: (optional) where is this the need for this
      target role declared (normally as a *FILENAME[:LINENUMBER]*).

    :param dict axes: (optional) dictionary keyed by string of the
      axes on which to spin this target role (see :ref:`testcase
      pairing testcase_pairing`).

      >>> dict(
      >>>     AXISNAME = [ VALUE0, VALUE 1... ],
      >>>     AXISNAME = None,
      >>> ...)

      The key name is the axis name, which as to be a valid Python
      identifier and the values are *None* (to get all the values
      from a field named as the axis in the inventory) or a list of
      values valid axis values (which an be *bool*, *int*, *float* or
      *str*).

      Note that when getting the values from the inventory, only
      values that apply to a target that matches the *spec* will
      be considered [*ic_spec* is ignored for this].

      See :ref:'axis specification <axis_specification>` for more
      information

    :param str,callable spec: (optional) target specification
      filter--used to filter which targets are acceptable for this
      role.

      This can be a string describing a logical expression or a
      function that does the filtering; the function *MUST* be
      not depend on global data other than the target inventory
      and be estable over calls, since its results will be cached.

      See :ref:'target filtering <target_filtering>` for more
      information

      FIXME: the function needs to be available on the core TCFL
      image, not on the testcase definition, otherwise it needs to be
      pickled?

    :param dict spec_args: (optional) dictionary of arguments to
      the *spec* call (if used)

    :param str,callable ic_spec: (optional) target specification
      filter for interconnectivity--used to filter which targets
      meet the connectivity needs of the testcase (eg: is target *A*
      is connected to networks *E* and *F*?).

      This is separate from the *spec* filter above for
      performance reasons. To calculate connectivity maps the
      permutations are heavily reduced if we have been able to
      first reduce and cache the valid targets and then cache by
      connectivity.

      For example, to request a target that is connected to
      another two targets (declared as interconnects)

      >>> ic_spec = pairer._spec_filter_target_in_interconnect,
      >>> ic_spec_args = { 'interconnects': [ 'ctl', 'nut' ] }

      See :ref:'target filtering and interconnectivity
      <target_filtering_ic>` for more information

    :param dict ic_spec_args: (optional) dictionary of arguments to
      the *ic_spec* call (if used)

    :param bool interconnects: if *True* consider, consider this
      role as an interconnect, a target that interconnects other
      targets (eg: a network).

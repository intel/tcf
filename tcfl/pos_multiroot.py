.. _pos_multiroot:

Provisioning OS: partitioning schema for multiple root FSs per device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Provisioning OS multiroot methodology partitions a system with
multiple root filesystems; different OSes are installed in each root
so it is fast to switch from one to another to run things in
automated fashion.

The key to the operation is that the server maintains a list of OS
images available to be rsynced to the target's filesystem. rsync can
copy straight or transmit only the minimum set of needed changes.

This also speeds up deployment of an OS to the root filesystems, as by
picking a root filesystem that has already installed one similar to
the one to be deployed (eg: a workstation vs a server version), the
amount of data to be transfered is greatly reduced.

Like this, the following scenario sorted from more to less data
transfer (and thus slowest to fastest operation):

- can install on an empty root filesystem: in this case a full
  installation is done

- can refresh an existing root fileystem to the destination: some
  things might be shared or the same and a partial transfer can be
  done; this might be the case when:

  - moving from a distro to another
  - moving from one version to another of the same distro
  - moving from one spin of one distro to another
  
- can update an existing root filesystem: in this case very little
  change is done and we are just verifying nothing was unduly
  modified.

.. _pos_multiroot_partsizes:

Partition Size specification
----------------------------

To simplify setup of targets, a string such as *"1:4:10:50"* is given
to denote the sizes of the different partitions:

- 1 GiB for /boot
- 4 GiB for swap
- 10 GiB for scratch (can be used for whatever the script wants, needs
  to be formated/initialized before use)
- 50 GiB for multiple root partitions (until the disk size is exhausted)

"""Report data to a MongoDB database
---------------------------------

This driver dumps all reported data to a MongoDB database, creating
one document per testcase.

Each document is a dictionary hierarchy of which includes summary data
and detailed messages and attachments.

See :class:`tcfl.report_mongodb.driver <driver>` for configuration
details.

The execution messages (pass/errr/fail/skip/block) are stored in a
subdocument called *results*. Data reports in a subdocument called
*data*.

For each testcase and the targets where it is ran on (identified by a
*hashid*) we generate a *document*; each report done for that this
*hashid* is a *record* in said document with any attachments stored.

Testcase execution results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each result document is keyed by *runid:hashid* and structured
as:

- result
- runid
- hashid
- tc_name
- target_name
- target_types
- target_server
- timestamp
- targets: dict of keyed by target name

  - TARGETNAME:

    - id
    - server
    - type
    - bsp_model

- results: list of

  - timestamp
  - ident
  - level
  - tag
  - message
  - attachments

- data: dictionary of data domain, name and value

Notes:

- When a field is missing we don't insert it to save space, it
  has to be considered an empty string (if we expected one) or
  none present


Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When giving SSL and passwords in the URL, the connection fails
  with messages such as *ConfigurationError: command SON(...)
  failed: auth failed*

  The installation of PyMongo in your system might be too old, we
  need > v3.

Pending
^^^^^^^

- when told to store an attachment PyMongo can't take, it is just
  throwing an exception--we shall convert that to something so the
  document is not lost

    Report results of testcase execution into a MongoDB database

    The records are written to a database pointed to by MongoDB URL :attr:`url`,
    database name :attr:`db_name`, collection :attr:`collection_name`.

    **Usage**

    1. Ensure you have a access to a MongoDB in ``HOST:PORT``,
       where you can create (or there is already) a database called
       ``DATABASENAME``.

    2. Create a TCF configuration file

              collection_name = "COLLECTIONNAME"
